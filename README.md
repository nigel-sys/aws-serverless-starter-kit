## Features

- **Backend:** Python AWS Lambda function, protected by Cognito authentication, exposed via API Gateway.
- **Frontend:** Static HTML/JS site hosted on S3 and served securely via CloudFront.
- **Authentication:** AWS Cognito User Pool for login/logout and securing API access.
- **Infrastructure as Code:** All resources provisioned via Terraform.

## Prerequisites

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html) >= 1.3.0
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- AWS account with permissions for Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, S3, and CloudFront

## Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/aws-serverless-starter-kit.git
cd aws-serverless-starter-kit/aws-serverless-starter-kit
```

### 2. Configure AWS credentials

```sh
aws configure
```

### 3. Deploy infrastructure

```sh
cd backend/terraform
terraform init
terraform apply
```

- This will provision all AWS resources.
- After apply, note the outputs for `frontend_url` (CloudFront domain), `client_id`, and `hosted_ui_url`.

### 4. Update Frontend Configuration

All configuration values (like CloudFront domain and Cognito settings) are centralized in `config.js`.

#### Steps:

1. Open the file:  
   `frontend/static-site/config.js`

2. Replace the placeholders with your actual values from the Terraform outputs:

   ```js
   window.APP_CONFIG = {
     clientId: 'your-cognito-client-id',
     redirectUri: 'https://your-cloudfront-domain/callback.html',
     cognitoDomain: 'https://your-cognito-domain.auth.region.amazoncognito.com',
     apiUrl: 'https://your-api-gateway-url/prod/hello',
   };
   ```

### 5. Upload frontend to S3

```sh
aws s3 sync ../../frontend/static-site/ s3://serverless-starter-frontend/
```

### 6. Access your app

- Open the CloudFront URL from the Terraform output in your browser.
- You will be redirected to Cognito for authentication.
